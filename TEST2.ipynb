We got crab nachos (with sea urchin \"queso\"), sticky rice tamal, fish tempura tacos, short rib confit, and two desserts (ice cream sandwich and corn ice cream taco)  Everything was very good. The crab nachos were as great as advertised. The duck that came on top of the tamal was excellent. The lime mayo in the tacos was great, although fitting the fish into the tortilla wasn't entirely easy. The tacos that resulted from the short rib dish were more structurally adequate, and the flavors really jumped. (We also thought the tortillas that came with this dish were better than the ones that came with the tacos -- weird, but maybe just a random thing.)\"\"\"\n",

The starchy rice was broken by the rich duck sauce. The combination was perfect. The Prawn was almost it's equal. Here, less effort provided equally interesting returns. A simple salted shallot (?) mix dropped over the top of a flawlessly prepared prawn.\n",

    "The dessert here demands a separate paragraph. I ordered the Avocado mousse, expecting something different. (Avocado is not typically found on dessert menus!) What I got defied expectations. The avocado was blended with Greek yogurt and scooped back into the mold of a half of an avocado and placed over a bed of lime ice shaving that resembled snow. Through the magic of food preparation, the mousse was \"painted\" to resemble a real avocado! It was food-based Trompe l'oeil! I was told that this is the most photographed plate in New York! Totally understandable. It deserves that accolade.\n",
